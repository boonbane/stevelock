# Rules
- Always use native Bun APIs where applicable
- Always export and import a single, top-level namespace instead of loose symbols
- Always `import path from "path"` instead of `import { whatever } from "path"`; same for `fs` and other Bun modules
- Prefer single word variable names
- Avoid using functions to organize code; instead, prefer to keep code in one function unless you need reuse
- Avoid `try` and `catch`; instead, prefer to return error codes
- Avoid `else` statements
- Avoid using `any`
- Avoid `let` statements
- Never write scripts with loose code; always put `main()` into a function and invoke it
- Never use `/tmp`; prefer `.cache/scratch`. Out-of-tree directory access forces manual approval, `.cache/scratch` lets you work autonomously
- Never write utilities as Bash scripts; always use TypeScript + Bun
- Never wrap `await foo()` in parentheses in an if statement
